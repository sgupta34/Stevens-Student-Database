# week-10
The Stevens community is very excited about the work you've been doing to gather information about students, classes, and instructors.  Your work is so popular that the community is asking for a website so everyone can see the results.

Your assignment is build a new web page to display a summary of each Instructor with her CWID, Name, Department, Course, and the number of students in the course.   For example, here's a screen dump of my solution:

You'll need to install Flask along with the database you created for Homework 11.  

Specifically, you'll need to:

Create a directory structure for your solution with a 'templates' subdirectory, and a base.html template.
Define a query using your SQLite database from Homework 11 that calculates the CWID, Name, Department, Course, and number of students.   The example from the lecture may be useful for this task.
Create a new template file for your new web page.  Start by understanding how it should look and then perhaps create an HTML with static data to test your HTML.
Update your static HTML to include Jinja2 variables and statements to use data passed with the render_template() call.
Create a Flask Python application to run your application.
Demonstrate that your code works properly by submitting a .zip file with all of the files from your solution plus a screen dump of your browser showing the output.
Update your GitHub repository to include a new branch with the web solution. 
The lecture notes should provide all of the information you need to complete this assignment, but the web has many good tutorials on Flask if you run into trouble. 

After that, celebrate the fact that you've completed your last homework assignment for SSW 810!
